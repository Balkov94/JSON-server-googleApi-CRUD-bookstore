        "description": "Follow this foolproof 21-day program and you can teach any litter-trained cat to use a toilet instead of a box. Discover a better way: Now cat owners everywhere can put down their scoops, stop ferrying backbreaking sacks of litter, enjoy a fresh-smelling home, and save hundreds of dollars a year. And make their cats happier, too! The requirements are simple: magazines or newspapers, masking tape, heavy-duty plastic wrap, a supply of litter, and a cat between the ages of six months and ten years (you can train an older cat, but it may take longer). Then, 21 days later, your cat will be using the toilet, just like any other civilized member of the family. For life. Toilet training a cat isn’t just for the owner’s convenience. Many cats equate the smell of the litter box with danger, causing constant stress, and the fragrances, dyes, and disinfectants found in most litters are detrimental to your pet’s well-being. Yes, it’s true: A toilet-trained cat is a happier, healthier cat.",
